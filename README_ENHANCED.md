## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Advanced Feature Engineering Techniques

```python
# Customer lifecycle stages
df['LifecycleStage'] = pd.cut(df['tenure'], 
                             bins=[0, 6, 12, 24, 60, 1000], 
                             labels=['New', 'Early', 'Growth', 'Mature', 'Long-term'])

# Service utilization score
df['ServiceUtilization'] = df[service_cols].sum(axis=1)
df['ValuePerService'] = df['MonthlyCharges'] / (df['ServiceUtilization'] + 1)

# K-means customer segmentation
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
df['CustomerSegment'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_cluster_scaled)
```

### Ensemble Model Configuration

```python
# XGBoost with optimization
xgb_params = {
    'n_estimators': 200,
    'learning_rate': 0.1,
    'max_depth': 6,
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8
}

# Voting ensemble
voting_clf = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('rf', rf_model), ('xgb', xgb_model), ('lgb', lgb_model)],
    voting='soft'
)
```

### Production Pipeline Features

```python
# Risk level classification
def determine_risk_level(self, probability: float) -> str:
    if probability >= 0.8: return 'Very High'
    elif probability >= 0.6: return 'High'
    elif probability >= 0.4: return 'Medium'
    elif probability >= 0.2: return 'Low'
    else: return 'Very Low'

# Business recommendations
def get_recommended_actions(self, probability: float, customer_data: Dict) -> List[str]:
    actions = []
    if probability >= 0.6:
        actions.extend(["Immediate retention campaign", "Personalized offer"])
    return actions
```
