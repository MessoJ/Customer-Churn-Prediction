# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
Download the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run the scripts in order:
1. `python data_preprocessing.py`
2. `python feature_engineering.py`
3. `python model_training.py`
4. `python model_evaluation.py`
5. `python visualization.py`

## Results
- Model Accuracy: 85%
- Precision: 0.83
- Recall: 0.72
- F1-Score: 0.77
- AUC-ROC: 0.89

Results and visualizations are saved in the `results/` directory.
